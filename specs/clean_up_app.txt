Clean up App
============

Overview
--------
The lua files in "app" are the oldest in qplan. I'd like to take a sweep through
these and separate what we're using from what we're not. I want to tighten all
of this up in general.

Implementation
--------------
. Move uneeded code from plan.lua [X][X][X]
. Tighten up work.lua [][][][]
. Tighten up router.lua [][][][]


1 - Move uneeded code from plan.lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's start by moving plan.lua over to a new file (like plan_algo), then we can
pull the functions we need back into plan.lua. OK, let's tighten up the code
that's currently in plan and see if we can tighten up references to it as well.

Let's also have Plan just store work and staff. We'll remove cutline, default
supply, etc.

We need to move work_array into m_plan as well. Done.

Let's rename select to be filters and then only include the functions we need.


TODO: I want plan to store work and staff in essentially array form. We don't
need to access any particular element at this time.

2 - Tighten up router.lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It may make sense to split the file up into different route files. Let's do this
by renaming the router.lua file and then creating a blank one to copy things
into. Done. I split these into different files for different types of routes.
